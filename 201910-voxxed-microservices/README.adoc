=== Cloud Native: why, oh why?

Presentedy by *Emmanuel Bernard* - *Red Hat*.

Emmanuel is Java Champion, Distinguished Engineer and Chief Architect Data at Red Hat (middleware).

His work is Open Source. He is most well known for his contributions and lead of the Hibernate projects as well as his contribution to Java standards. +
His most recent endeavour is [Quarkus](https://quarkus.io) (A Kubernetes Native Java stack tailored for GraalVM & OpenJDK HotSpot, crafted from the best of breed Java libraries and standards).

You can follow him on twitter at [@emmanuelbernard](http://twitter.com/emmanuelbernard). &#35;quarkus &#35;debezium &#35;infinispan &#35;hibernate-orm &#35;hibernate-search &#35;hibernate-validator &#35;hibernate-ogm &#35;ceylon &#35;JPA &#35;bean-validation &#35;lescastcodeurs

==== Abstract

People are going Cloud Native, are going for microservices. But why?

In this session, we will discuss what made these new architecture style possible, why and with which objective should we embrace them. +
And last but not least, let's explore some of the key problems you will encounter: are you resilient and responsive in a systemic manner, why not? Communication, how to handle the explosion? etc.

After this session, you will be armed with a better understanding of your gaps and what are the next steps in your Cloud Native and microservices journey.

==== Notes

.What is Cloud Native?
image:monday_01.jpg[]

.Une tentative de réponse
image:monday_02.jpg[]

*Multi clouds* is a real concern: either for multi zones, or real multi clouds.

Comme d'habitude : 1 monotith ~20 microservices ~200 functions

.Why go through this pain? (advantages)
image:monday_03.jpg[]

Data isolation concern. +
Each microservice must have its own storage, but how to share the data?

When you swith from one microservice to another, how do you also "swith the data" (associated with the microservice switched off)

.Message-Driven & Reactive Microservices
image:monday_04.jpg[]

.Reactive Systems (slightly different from reactive programming)
image:monday_05.jpg[]

.Density issue: Java at its disavantage
image:monday_06.jpg[]

-> Java consumes quite a lot of memory when compared to other recent technologies (NodeJS, Go, etc.). +
It was created to handle few big systems.

=== Containerization crossroads: Experiences-Experiments-Expectations

Presentedy by *Ana-Maria Mihalceanu* - *IBM*.

Ana-Maria Mihalceanu is a custom application development enthusiast, co-founder of Bucharest Software Craftsmanship Community and a constant adopter of challenging technical scenarios. Some of her older experiments are available on Dzone.

In 2016, as tech passionate of cloud application development she achieved IBM Certified Application Developer - Cloud Platform v1. +
Since then, she has enriched her cloud expertise by learning and certifying as a Salesforce Developer and attained a better understanding on how to integrate different types of cloud offerings.

Other passions? The knowledge hunt through reading and growing fashion skills through shopping.

==== Abstract

Containers seem like a technology that came out of nowhere to improve application development, yet the idea dates since the 1970s when the concept was first employed on Unix systems to better isolate application code. +
Containers evolved, bringing forth abstraction capabilities that are broadly applied within enterprise IT. +
However, expectations grow regardless if you just started your quest for flexible application development or juggling expertly with Microservices, Docker, Kubernetes. +
Let's debate lessons learned and experiment to meet expectations!

==== Notes

.A brief history around containerization
image:monday_07.jpg[]

_"We love containers"_, because of their benefits:

* instant boot
* portability
* modularity

Container *build time* principles:

* single concern principle
* self-containment principle
* image immutability principle

Container *run time* principles:

* high obervability principle

.Slimming big docker image
image:monday_08.jpg[]

* Ana-Maria reminds us of the classic hack of `&&` in Dockerfile to reduce the number of layers.
* She also recommends the use of multi-stages Docker builds.

.Security observations
image:monday_09.jpg[]

Same kind of advise for Kubernetes: set security context as non root to true.

*Resource management*: CPU / memory / ephemeral storage

image:monday_10.jpg[]

For Kubernetes and its pods, you can't have at the same time VPA (Vertical Pod Autoscaler) and HPA (Horizontal Pod Autoscaler)

When developping with Kubernetes, Ana-Maria advise: _share your experience (with your colleagues), and experiment more_

=== Past, Present and Future of Microservices

Presentedy by *Sebastien Stormacq* (@sebsto) - *Amazon Web Services*.

Seb is writing code since he first touched a Commodore 64 in the mid-eighties. +
He is inspiring builders to unlock the value of the AWS cloud, using his secret blend of passion, enthusiasm, customer advocacy, curiosity and creativity. +
His interests are about software architectures, developer tools and mobile computing. +
If you want to sell him something, be sure it has an API.

==== Abstract

Let's reflect on the Microservices architectural pattern, how the industry came there, what are today's challenges and what can we expect in the future?

Seb uses is 25+ year of experience in the industry and key position as observer of cloud infrastructure, talking with many customers in different industries and geographies to identify our industry's trends.

==== Notes

What is a Microservice?

* independent
* autonomous
* specialized
* single team

.Amazon microservices map
image:monday_11.jpg[]

-> main point is Amazon main page

2010: Amazon monolithic application -> services -> microservices

Sebastien's advise for microservices (a classic one): _Think big, BUT start *really* small_ +
That was the case for Amazon S3: it starts with only 8 microservices, and now has more than 200.

.Communication styles: synchronous or asynchronous
image:monday_12.jpg[]

-> We are moving more and more towards *asynchronous communication*

_"If you build it, you run it"_

Keep the dev team quite small: ideal team at Amazon -> a "2 pizza" team.

_"Let's risk a peak of the future"_:

* All the code you ever write is business logic

*Code deployment vs code activation*. +
-> At amazon, code is deployed several months (???) before being used.

As a conclusion:

image:monday_13.jpg[]

-> on pourrait résumer ça en : "Développer du code métier, PAS de la plomberie (c'est le boulot d'autres personnes !)"

=== All you need to know to get started with microservices on Kubernetes

Presentedy by *Alain Regnier* - Alto Labs.

Alain Regnier is a Technical Architect and Entrepreneur passionate about innovation and new technologies. +
He has spent 10 years in Silicon Valley working for startups and large companies, where he co-authored various standards about Web Services and Connected Devices.

With Alto Labs he provides consulting services around Kubernetes, Google Cloud and Web Applications architecture. +
He also helps startups develop prototypes and POCs. +
He is a GDE Cloud (Google Developer Expert) and certified Google Cloud Architect. +
He is the founder of the GDG Cloud Paris (Google Developer Group) and StartupVillage.

==== Abstract

This presentation will explain how to build a microservices based application on kubernetes.

After covering the basic concepts and the various kubernetes resources required for our architecture, we will go through the creation and deployment of a concrete example. +
We will also look at common tasks such as component update and issues investigation. +
Finally we will discuss various features of the architecture such as service discovery, redundancy, scaling and autohealing... +
The presentation will include tips and feedback from real life examples.

==== Notes

.Why use containers?
image:monday_14.jpg[]

.And now why Kubernetes?
image:monday_15.jpg[]

Google has used containers (internally) since *2004*.

*GKE*: Google Kubernetes Engine

*Pod*: group of containers deployed together

.Kubernetes resource: *pod*
image:monday_16.jpg[]

.Kubernetes resource: *deployment*
image:monday_17.jpg[]

.Kubernetes resource: *service*
image:monday_18.jpg[]

.Kubernetes resource: *Ingress*
image:monday_19.jpg[]

* *Ingress*: Collection of rules *allowing external connections* to reach services on the cluster

.Kubernetes resource: *Secret and ConfigMap*
image:monday_20.jpg[]

.La démo d'Alain
image:monday_21.jpg[] +
image:monday_22.jpg[]

* Front service with a replica factor of 3.

.Command line to create the Kubernetes cluster
image:monday_23.jpg[]

Alain advise: _"Don't put your password in your images, attach them instead..."_

.Conclusion
image:monday_24.jpg[]

.Service Mesh and Istio
image:monday_25.jpg[]

* *Istio*: with too many microservices, it's difficult to know which microservice is talking to which microservice. Istio, as a *service mesh*, makes it easier to understand what is happening and control what is happening.

=== Jakarta EE - Not just for Servers (JAX-RS comes to FaaS)

Presentedy by *Chris Bailey* - *IBM*.

Chris is the Chief Architect for Cloud Native Runtimes at IBM, leading teams that contributing to open source communities for the Node.js, Java and Swift runtimes. +
Chris has worked on runtimes, programming languages, and application frameworks for almost 20 years, and has most recently been focussed on enhancing frameworks and providing modules to make it easier to build best-practice cloud native applications.

==== Abstract

Function-as-a-service (FaaS) and serverless platforms increase productivity, enabling you to focus on application code, with the platform taking care of how to deploy, configure, run, and scale the code. +
They do however require you to adopt a new programming model, creating generic handlers or actions that lack the expressive APIs that you get from frameworks and standards such as Jakarta EE.

In this session, you’ll learn how it’s now possible to create FaaS- and serverless-based applications using the same APIs you use today such as JAX-RS and you’ll see a live demo of an application being built and deployed as a cloud native application on Kubernetes using a combination of open source tools and Knative serving.

==== Notes

.Classic app
image:monday_27.jpg[]

.with Kubernetes
image:monday_28.jpg[]

.with CloudFoundry
image:monday_29.jpg[]

-> With *FaaS*, the only stack you need is a *lone JavaEE application*.

IMPORTANT: *FaaS* is for functions AND serverless.

.nearly 60% usage of AWS lambda is Node
image:monday_30.jpg[]

With express (NodeJS front main tech): Startup, handles a request and get the result to the user -> 0,532 sec

.framework statup times
image:monday_31.jpg[]

-> Les applications Spring Boot classiques sont beaucoup plus lentes à démarrer que celles basées sur Express. +
PAR CONTRE, quand on commence à utiliser des frameworks comme *Quarkus*, on arrive à des temps de démarrage équivalents, voire plus rapides !

*Knative* will add containers based on usage, and remove ones based on the same usage.

Donc, functions and Knative ?

With Apache OpenWhisk :

image::monday_32.jpg[]

-> On voit qu'on prend un `JsonObject` en param, et qu'on renvoie un objet similaire en retour.

Appsody stacks (se renseigner !)

image:monday_33.jpg[]

Et quand on utilise Appsody pour du FaaS, cela devient :

image:monday_34.jpg[]

https://appsody.dev/[Appsody] (https://github.com/appsody[GitHub]) : _Appsody enables you to quickly build and deploy cloud-native applications._

Chris nous fait une déma basée sur Appsody, à l'aide de Visual Studio Code, et nous montre de belles fonctionnalités de debug de la solution (break point dans VS Code et interaction directe avec le code déployé)

Nobody is doing FaaS with Java today, this mainly because of startup time. +
To correct this: *Quarkus* / *Knative* / *Appsody*

=== 7 Reasons why your microservices should use Event Sourcing & CQRS

Presentedy by *Hugh McKee* - *Lightbend*.

Hugh McKee is a developer advocate at Lightbend. He has had a long career building applications that evolved slowly, that inefficiently utilized their infrastructure, and were brittle and prone to failure. +
Hugh has learned from his past mistakes, battle scars, and a few wins. And the learning never stops. +
Now his focus is on helping other developers and architects build resilient, scalable, reactive, distributed systems.

==== Abstract

Event Sourcing & CQRS offers a compelling and often controversial alternative for persisting data in microservice systems environments.

This alternate approach is new for most of us, and it is justified to have a healthy level of skepticism towards any shiny new and often over-hyped solution. +
However, what is interesting is that this is so new that even the champions and evangelists often overlook the real benefits provided by this new way of capturing and storing data.

In this talk, we will look at 7 of the top reasons for using Event Sourcing & CQRS. +
These reasons covered go beyond the often referenced benefits, such as event stores are natural audit logs, or offering the ability to go back in history to replay past events.

The primary goal of this talk is to flip your view from limited to no use of ES & CQRS to an alternate perspective of what you give up when you elect to not use it as the go-to persistence strategy.

==== Notes

.break the read versus write performance bottleneck
image:monday_36.jpg[]
image:monday_37.jpg[]

-> at *the end*, we get *eventually consistent*.

.semantics of delivery
image:monday_38.jpg[]

* *at-most-once* meaning maybe-once
* *at-least-once* meaning once-or-more
* *exactly-once* meaning essentially-once

=== Supercharge product development with cloud best practices

Presentedy by *Sebastien Stormacq* - *Amazon Web Services*.

==== Abstract

Continuous Integration (CI) and Continuous Delivery (CD) help developers automate the software release process. +
The faster you can release new features and fix bugs, the quicker you can innovate and respond to customer needs.

AWS provides developer tools that help you automate the end-to-end lifecycle of your serverless applications.

In this session, we will discuss methods for automating the deployment of serverless or containerised applications, using services such as *AWS CodePipeline* and *AWS CodeBuild*, and techniques such as *canary deployments* and *automatic rollbacks*.

==== Notes

Subtitle for the talk: CI/CD for Modern Applications

.Infrastructure as code goals

=== From Zero to Hero with Kafka Connect

Presentedy by *Robin Moffatt* - *Confluent*.

Robin is a Developer Advocate at Confluent, the company founded by the original creators of Apache Kafka, as well as an Oracle Groundbreaker Ambassador and ACE Director (Alumnus). +
His career has always involved data, from the old worlds of COBOL and DB2, through the worlds of Oracle and Hadoop, and into the current world with Kafka. +
His particular interests are analytics, systems architecture, performance testing and optimization. +
He blogs at http://cnfl.io/rmoff and http://rmoff.net/ (and previously http://ritt.md/rmoff) and can be found tweeting grumpy geek thoughts as @rmoff.

Outside of work he enjoys drinking good beer and eating fried breakfasts, although generally not at the same time.

==== Abstract

Integrating Apache Kafka with other systems in a reliable and scalable way is often a key part of a streaming platform. +
Fortunately, Apache Kafka includes the Connect API that enables streaming integration both in and out of Kafka. Like any technology, understanding its architecture and deployment patterns is key to successful use, as is knowing where to go looking when things aren't working.

This talk will discuss the key design concepts within Kafka Connect and the pros and cons of standalone vs distributed deployment modes.

We'll do a live demo of building pipelines with Kafka Connect for streaming data in from databases, and out to targets including Elasticsearch. +
With some gremlins along the way, we'll go hands-on in methodically diagnosing and resolving common issues encountered with Kafka Connect.

The talk will finish off by discussing more advanced topics including Single Message Transforms, and deployment of Kafka Connect in containers.

==== Notes

image:monday_47.jpg[]

In the demo from Robin, *Kafka Connect* *pulls the data from the source*, and *pushes it to the sink*.

image:monday_48.jpg[]

[IMPORTANT]
====
schema MATTERS! +
If you "just" use JSON, you need to enforce the schema somewhere else (meaning using Confluence Schema Registry)
====

image:monday_49.jpg[]

.*Workers* are JVM process
image:monday_50.jpg[]

The best choice is nearly always to go for *distributed* deployment, and *NOT* standalone one :

* standalone deployment is NOT fault tolerant
* standalone deployment does NOT scale

Distributed deployment also starts with 1 JVM, but has the possibility to scale to others.

image:monday_51.jpg[]

A classic error, when expected Avro message is NOT actually Avro:

image::monday_52.jpg[]

Tout un système de monitoring de Kafka Connect est mis à disposition par Confluent.

Confluent met également à disposition une version "fully managed" de Kafka in the cloud.

=== Kubernetes Native JHipster microservices

Presentedy by *Pierre Besson* - *Liquidshare*.

Currently working as Site Reliability Engineer at Liquidshare, I contribute to JHipster since 2016. +
My contribution to the project have focused on integrating the Spring Cloud stack, docker and kubernetes support as well as monitoring.

==== Abstract

Kubernetes is eating the world. +
Teams around the world are realizing that Kubernetes is the answer to achieve immutable and declarative container based deployments.

The JHipster project was quick to jump on the hype, starting work on the Kubernetes sub-generator back in 2016. +
However, in the meantime Kubernetes has evolved continuously and is now much more than simply a runtime for your microservices. +
Many projects such as Istio and custom Operators plug directly into the Kubernetes platform and offer solutions to microservices concerns (discovery, resiliency, monitoring, ...).

This talk will show how to fully utilize Kubernetes as a platform for a Java microservices architecture generated by JHipster.

==== Notes

The goal of JHipster is NOT to generate a "Hello world" application, but a full one implementing all best practises.

.What does JHipster?
image:monday_53.jpg[]

.What does Kubernetes?
image:monday_54.jpg[]

Internally, everything in Kubernetes works thanks to Controllers.

.How does Kubernetes work?
image:monday_55.jpg[]

Kubernetes: an *extensible* platform

* *Operator*: Software extensions to Kubernetes based on custom Kubernetes resources
* *Servise mesh*: a set of infrastructure services that imlement microservices patterns : +
image:monday_56.jpg[]

.JHipster supports 2 microservices platforms
image:monday_57.jpg[]

* *Spring CLoud*: Java only
* *Istio*: Polyglot

.Istio sidecar proxy mechanism
image:monday_58.jpg[]

.Database in Kubernetes
NOTE: Pierre reminder: It is NOT recommended to run a database in Kubernetes all by yourself (tricky)

* Tool to know: *Kiali*, a monitoring dashboard for *Istio*.
* Grafana is used to monitor Kubernetes performance

NOTE: Kubernetes knows nothing about your applications, it only knows about containers. +
So if you need to know about your applications internal performances, you will have to install some external tools.

==== Avis

Talk très intéressant, montrant bien les évolutions de JHipster et son intégration de Kubernetes. +
A garder sous le coude.

=== Transactions in your micro-services architecture

Presentedy by *Rudy De Busscher* - *Payara Services*.

I love to create (web) applications with the Java EE platform and MicroProfile implementations. +
I have spent the last 10 years implementing various projects in a team for customers, helped various Open Source projects (MicroProfile, DeltaSpike, PrimeFaces, Apache Myfaces, ...), and do support for Payara Server customers. +
I'm also already working 4 years around Web Application Security using OAuth2, OpenId Connect, and JWT.

==== Abstract

How can you make different pieces of your unit of work consistent in the distributed setup of your micro-service application? +
You associate the term transaction probably with a database, but the data source can be anything including a database in the micro-service world.

The MicroProfile Long Running Actions specification is based on sagas and the OASIS LRA transaction model specification. +
It defines the framework to guarantee the eventual consistency requirement using compensating actions for example.

This session will explain you the challenges and concepts of the MP LRA framework. And of course, you can see it in action with various demos.

==== Notes

.To be ACID or not?
image:monday_59.jpg[]

-> Most companies choose to *give up consistency* (and to have eventually consistency)

.MicroService world
image:monday_60.jpg[]

.Saga pattern
image:monday_61.jpg[width=600]

-> *Saga pattern*: ensures that each step of the business process has a *compensating action* to undo the work completerd in the case of partial failures.

MicroProfile Long Running action:

* based on the *Saga pattern*
* *still work in progress*
* features
	** loose coupling
	** guaranteed a globally consistent outcome
	** compensable actions

=== Event-Driven Microservices, the Sense, the Non-sense and a Way Forward

Presentedy by *Allard Buijze* - *AxonIQ*.

Allard Buijze is Founder and CTO at AxonIQ with a solid software development background. +
Starting at the age of 6, he has developed a great passion for programming and has guided both large and small organizations in building performant and scalable applications. +
Allard likes to help customers make appropriate future-proof, technical decisions. +
As a former software architect specializing within the field of "scalability" and "high performance" computing, he has worked on several small and large projects, where performance and complexity were recurring themes. +
Allard is convinced that a good domain model is the beginning of contributing to the overall performance of an application. +
From this conviction, he has developed the Axon Framework. +
Allard has given several trainings in the areas of scalable architectures, test driven development, application design and clean coding. +
He strongly believes that good craftsmanship can only be achieved through continuous and intensive exchange of experience with others. +
The last years, he has been investigating and applying CQRS to a number of projects. +
As a result, he created the Axon Framework, an open source Java framework that helps developers create scalable and extensible applications. +
Axon has a growing community and has already been successfully introduced in several high-profile projects around the world.

==== Abstract

Microservices, and especially their Event-Driven variants, are at the very peak of the hype cycle and, according to some, on their way down. +
Meanwhile, a large number of success stories and failures have been shared about this architectural style. How do we ensure that we don't throw away the baby with the bathwater and end up re-inventing the same concepts again a decade from now?

In this talk, I want to zoom in on different aspects around microservices. +
What are the promises made and how did it deliver on those? +
How did technology surrounding microservices evolve and impact our decisions? +
Lastly, I will look forward how can we be pragmatic about microservices, avoiding some of the common pitfalls and helping ensure ourselves that we get the promised benefits, but without the pain.

==== Notes

Allard est un bon orateur, avec de l'humour 😄 +
Pour preuve son exemple de l'architecture BBC (Box -> Box -> Cylinder), qui vire par moment au Big Ball of Mud (le bousier sur son oeuvre comparé à l'architecte défendant sa "création")

image:monday_63.jpg[]

.Tellement vrai !
image:monday_64.jpg[]

.Location transparency
image:monday_65.jpg[]

.Event hell ???
image:monday_66.jpg[]

IMPORTANT: *NOT everything is an event!*

-> Other things exist: *commands* and *queries*

.Command AND events AND queries
image:monday_67.jpg[]

IMPORTANT: An event is a message, but not every message is an event

*Event Sourcing*:

* Every that happened is represented by an Event

.Why use event sourcing?
image:monday_68.jpg[]

The challenges for Event Sourcing, yesterday and today:

* Dealing with increasing storage size: NO MORE AN ISSUE
* Complex ...

.CQRS
image:monday_69.jpg[]

Be careful with communication, because *communication is a contract*. +
A contract but you don't with whom you are married...

To conclude:

* consider commands and queries as much as events
* sharing is caring
* beware coupling across bounded contexts

=== Panel on Microservices

Presentedy by *Mathilde Rigabert Lemée*, *Emmanuel Bernard*, *Sebastien Stormacq*, *Ana-Maria Mihalceanu*.

==== Abstract

On this panel you will be able to ask questions on Microservices to our keynote speakers.

=== Deploying Spring Boot microservices on Azure

Presentedy by *Julien Dubois* - *Microsoft*.

Julien is an Azure developer advocate at Microsoft, specialized on Java and Spring. +
Julien is also the lead developer of JHipster and a Java Champion.

==== Abstract

Did you know Microsoft has a whole engineering team dedicated to Spring Boot, and that for the last 3 years they have ensured that Spring Boot applications work great on Azure? +
We'll see how Java's &#35;1 framework works on one of the world's top cloud provider, including many tips and news on our latest releases.

=== The Evolution From Monolith to Microservices to Serverless and Beyond

Presented by *Hugh McKee* - *Lightbend*.

==== Abstract

If you are a developer or an architect, the odds are that you grew up building systems that are now commonly known as monoliths. +
In the last few years, we've seen a significant evolutionary shift to systems composed of microservices. +
Today we are witnessing the birth of serverless.

The rate of evolutionary change is accelerating. But what is changing and what remains the same?

In this talk, we will look at the evolution from the monolith to serverless seeking to extract the variables and the constants. +
We will also look at the progression from serverless to an inevitable future of frictionless computing.

==== Notes

.Even with Kubernetes, we don't use all available resources
image:tuesday_07.jpg[]

Even if better than monolith, we are only moving the problem a bit further. +
Whereas for *FaaS* (serverless), this time, *the design is made to only use what is required*.

.FaaS / serverless
image:tuesday_08.jpg[]

Breaking the monolith is OK, but breaking the related database is a much harder challenge. +
You need to loosely couple your microservices so as to be able to break the database.

image:tuesday_09.jpg[]

Pour éviter le couple direct d'un microservice avec plusieurs autres, on passe par un message bus (et donc une communication asynchrone) :

image::tuesday_10.jpg[]

D'après Hugh, on commence les microservices avec de la communication synchrone, et lorsqu'on se rend compte de ses limites, on passe à de l'asynchrone. +
-> Et après cela on passe au serverless.

.request / response serverless function
image:tuesday_11.jpg[]

.request / response and publish / subscribe functions linked by a message bus
image:tuesday_12.jpg[]

Which could lead to the following chain flow using publish / subscribe:

image:tuesday_13.jpg[]

We are now moving towards some new serverless features, like *stateful functions* but with a cost.

=== How I Learned to Stop Worrying and Love the Monolith

Presented by *Ania Wyrwinska* - *OLX Group*.

Java/PHP/Javascript Developer for more than 13 years, furiously splitting monoliths every day

==== Abstract

Nowadays most of the developers sooner or later would run into a fun but scary challenge: there is an ancient monolith that needs to be split into microservices, otherwise it would reach the critical mass and explode.

It seems that everything was already said and done about it, so why we keep talking about it? +
The journey is long and the road is bumpy.

Is there a light at the end of the tunnel for the ones that started losing hope? Come to my talk if you want to learn how we approached this situation at OLX Group, one of the biggest online classifieds platforms in the world. +
I will talk about different architectural strategies that we have tried and how did they work for us.

=== Pact tests: how we split up the monolithic deploy

Presented by *Phil Hardwick* - *Mettle*.

I'm a software developer at Mettle, a challenger business bank backed by Natwest, where I focus on customer onboarding and keeping us on the right side of the regulators! +
I'm a java developer with over 7 years experience. I've been involved with a large variety of projects, from public to private clients, with different teams and different ideas of what microservices are. +
I have a passion for quality and excelling at meeting non-functional requirements.

==== Abstract

At Mettle, we built our application as microservices from the start yet still fell into the trap of a monolithic deploy.

We built the services independently but then deployed all the changes once a week. +
The key problem was: how do we know that when we deploy this one service it won't break everything? +
To fix this, we used consumer driven contract testing (using Pact) to make our services independently deployable and move towards flexible continuous delivery. +
Now all changes are deployed straight to production with confidence.

I'm going to share our learnings so you can get the most out of Pact and avoid the pitfalls we found along the way. +
We will also spend time exploring the benefits of contract testing and how to implement it in your services and CI process. +
You should come away with a head start in understanding contracts and how it could give you confidence to deliver more frequently.

=== An introduction to Apache Kafka - this is Event Streaming, not just Messaging

Presented by *Katherine Stanley* - *IBM*.

Katherine Stanley is a Software Engineer in the IBM Event Streams team based in the UK. +
Through her work on IBM Event Streams she has gained experience running Apache Kafka on Kubernetes and running enterprise Kafka applications.

In her previous role she specialised in cloud native Java applications and microservices architectures. +
Katherine has co-authored an IBM Redbook on Java microservices and has contributed to the open source microservice project Game On. +
She enjoys sharing her experiences and has presented at conferences around the world, including the Kafka Summits in New York and London, JavaLand in Germany and JFokus in Sweden.

==== Abstract

The amount of data the world produces is growing exponentially every year and many companies are realising the potential of harnessing this data.

A lot of this is generated in the form of a never ending stream of events, with publishers creating the events and subscribers consuming them in many different ways. +
This is where Apache Kafka comes in, Kafka isn't just a messaging system - it's an event streaming platform.

This session will introduce Kafka and explain concepts such as topic partitioning, consumer groups and exactly-once semantics. +
Finally, learn about more advanced concepts such as stream processing using the Java Kafka Streams library, cross-datacenter replication and integration with other messaging systems.

=== Building a platform to integrate serverless and on-premise services

Presented by *Marcos Almeida* - *INVIVOO Software*.

Marcos ALMEIDA is a senior Software Engineer at INVIVOO Software where he develops its light microservices orchestration engine Koordinator. +
He is also a senior consultant in INVIVOO's Front End expertise.

After a PhD where he worked on software and business processes support tools, he worked as a researcher engineer in international industrial research projects on cloud and big data applications.

==== Abstract

Hybrid cloud services tend to move towards silos because of heterogeneous architectures (REST APIs, pub / sub message queues, functions, grids, ...). +
The integration of these different worlds often involves rewriting code to overcome communication issues between services.

XComponent Scenario is a platform designed for the hybrid cloud to solve this problem. +
It provides a service catalogue and a set of standard connectors integrating serverless functions, REST APIs and other on-premise services in the same workflow.

Let’s see how to handle all your services (AWS, Azure, on-premise, …) and capitalize on your Information System in one place without effort.

=== Looking back on migrating 30 microservices to a monorepository

Presented by *Darya Talanina* - *Theodo*.

Lead developer at Theodo, Darya loves creating products that improve the everyday life of people. +
In her free time, she likes hiking and exploring France.

==== Abstract

Five years ago, my company decided to switch to microservices. +
In five year, we grew our architecture to 30 microservices, organised in several repositories. +
The growing number of microservices (and, thus, repositories) had a negative impact on our developer experience and productivity, including:

* struggle to perform evolutions across several microservices (like updating dependencies versions)
* time-consuming pull requests in several repositories for a single feature
* difficulty to share best practices between teams
* bugs in production due to partially merged code

To solve this issues, we decided to migrate all 30 microservices to a monorepo. +
Over the course of several weeks, we had a team dedicated to performing the migration. We migrated all the microservices while:

* preserving git history of every single microservice
* keeping the Continuous Integration flow fast
* adding tools to further improve developer experience and productivity
* and introducing zero bugs in production!

This talk will give you the plan to painlessly migrate your microservices to a monorepo as well as solutions to address the major pitfalls of such a migration.

=== riffing on Kubernetes

Presented by *Florent Biville* - *Pivotal*.

Software developer at Pivotal, working on https://projectriff.io/. +
Spring Meetup Paris, Paris Hackergarten meetup organizer. hack.commit.push conference organizer.

==== Abstract

Kubernetes is a generic, extensible platform of platforms. +
It has gained significant momentum: we are all talking about it, and some of us are even using it.

However, the journey from vanilla Kubernetes to a production-ready environment may be long and perilous with so many competing choices in a growing ecosystem. Does it have to be that way? Not at all! +
riff (https://projectriff.io/), combined with Knative, brings useful abstractions and a unified improved(1) user experience to the table:

* Simplified installation process based on the recent Cloud Native Application Bundle standard * 0-N pod autoscaling (notice how scale-to-zero rhymes with pay-as-you-go?)
* Polyglot function support with Buildpacks v3, building from source
* Emergent stateful streaming support

If you want to learn more about the next-gen open source serverless platform and have (work)loads of fun(ctions), join me!

(1) This talk does not feature a gazillion lines of YAML, and no eyes were hurt in the making of this talk.

==== Abstract

These days, you can’t swing a dry erase marker without hitting someone talking about microservices. +
Developers are studying Eric Evan’s prescient book Domain Driven Design. +
Teams are refactoring monolithic apps, looking for bounded contexts and defining a ubiquitous language.

And while there have been countless articles, videos, and talks to help you convert to microservices, few have spent any appreciable time asking if a given application should be a microservice.

In this talk, I will show you a set of factors you can apply to help you decide if something deserves to be a microservice or not. +
We’ll also look at what we need to do to maintain a healthy micro(services)biome.
